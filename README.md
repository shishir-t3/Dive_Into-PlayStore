The deployed application link -- https://freakyeinstein-dive-into-playstore-deploy-ki4ke0.streamlitapp.com/
Clear cache before you start using the application.

All the files in the assets folder are fetched from various sources, cleaned and pre-processed to input them into our training model.

You can clone the repository and follow these steps if you want to make changes for the application and keep it working 

- clone it in a directory
- use the command `pipenv shell`.
- use the command `pipenv install`.
- once the virtual environment is ready use the command `streamlit run deploy.py` to run on the local machine.
